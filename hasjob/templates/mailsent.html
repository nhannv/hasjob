        We sent you an email to confirm your email address.
        Please click on the link within and your job will
        be published. The email also contains information
        on how you may edit or close the job post.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you do not receive this email within the next hour,
        one of two things may have happened:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>The email has landed in your Spam or Junk folder, or</li>
        <li>Your email address was incorrect and the mail bounced.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The latter is a very likely scenario if this is the first time
        you are using Hasjob. Please edit the post again from
        <a href="{{ url_for('browse_drafts') }}">your drafts</a> and check
        the email address. If you made a group email in Google Apps, it may
        not be configured to receive email from outside your domain.
